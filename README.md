# WatchDog
- A particularly good tool for administrators to help prevent hacking and controls, upgrading to their anticheats

# Warning
- I need you to try it because I have not tested it on my :)

# features
- Banwave ✔
- Good handling of data ✔
- Like Hypixel? ❌
- Report ✔

# How to setup ?
- This looks like the player's violation through your anticheat
```php
   WatchDog::getInstance()->createTableData([
      "killaura" => 0,
      "autoclick" => 0,
   ]);
```

- If you want more violations for players staying at the functions already available and anti-hacking
```php
   WatchDog::getInstance()->addViolations($player, "killaura");
```
